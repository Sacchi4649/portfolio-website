<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Things I am into are solving problems, exploring, and learning technology. I
  am interested in Web Development and Cloud Computing. I have few experiences
  in using Java language to create desktop app, NodeJS to create API with
  ExpressJs framework, deployment by App Engine and Cloud Run on Google Cloud
  Platform, and using database with Mongo and MariaDB. I am always willing to
  learn new things. I am flexible enough to adapt and able to work whether as a
  team or individually.
